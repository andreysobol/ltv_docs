# LTV Protocol Testnets

The LTV Protocol is deployed on multiple testnets to demonstrate and test the leveraged tokenized vault functionality with different underlying lending protocols.

## Available Testnets

### [Ghost Testnet](./ghost_testnet.md)
The Ghost testnet features a custom lending protocol (HodlMyBeer) with Magic ETH (MAE) as a synthetic liquid staking token. This testnet demonstrates the LTV Protocol's flexibility with custom lending systems and provides a controlled environment for testing yield strategies.

### [Aave Sepolia Testnet](./aave_testnet.md)
The Aave LTV Vault leverages the Sepolia Aave V3 lending market, allowing users to deposit WETH and WBTC to earn yield through leveraged positions. This testnet demonstrates the LTV Protocol's integration with one of the most established DeFi lending protocols.

### [Morpho Sepolia Testnet](./morpho_testnet.md)
The Morpho LTV Vault utilizes the Sepolia Morpho lending market, supporting WETH and USDC deposits for leveraged yield generation. This deployment showcases the protocol's compatibility with Morpho's peer-to-peer lending infrastructure.
